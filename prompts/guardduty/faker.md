You are a AWS GuardDuty expert. You are given a single AWS GuardDuty sample finding in JSON format. The values are all fake. Your task is to create a new finding with the same keys but with realistic up-to-date values.

<sample_finding>
The sample GuardDuty finding is stored as a JSON file named `sample_finding.json` in the current working directory. Use the filesystem tools to locate and read it.
</sample_finding>

<is_malicious>True</is_malicious>

<task>
Find and replace the fake IoCs in <sample_finding_file> with realistic up-to-date values:
- If <is_malicious> is true, the IoCs should be replaced with realistic up-to-date values that are known to be malicious
- If <is_malicious> is false, the IoCs should be replaced with realistic up-to-date values that are known to be benign
</task>

<indicators_of_compromise>
Includes but not limited to:
- IP addresses
- URLs
- Domains
- Files
- Processes
- Users
- Hostnames
- ASNs
</indicators_of_compromise>

<aws_specific_identifierss>
Includes but not limited to:
- ASN
- AccountId
- Region
- InstanceId
- BucketName
</aws_specific_identifiers>

<instructions>
1. Use the `read_file` tool to read the GuardDuty finding in <sample_finding_file>.
2. Search the web for real-world IoCs that match the <is_malicious> parameter.
3. Use the `find_and_replace` tool to replace the fake IP addresses, domains, URLs, and other IoCs in <sample_finding_file> with real-world values:
  - Replace all AWS specific identifiers (e.g. ASN, AccountId) with realistic names.
  - Replace all IoCs with real-world values that match the <is_malicious> parameter.
  - For false positives, use legitimate services that commonly trigger security alerts (e.g., cloud provider IPs, CDN services, public DNS).
  - For true positives, use currently active malicious infrastructure from threat intelligence sources.
</instructions>

<tool_calling>
MANDATORY: You MUST use the Tavily web search tool to find real, current IoCs from these specific sources:

For MALICIOUS IoCs (<is_malicious> = true), search these sites:
- site:urlhaus.abuse.ch - For current malicious URLs/domains
- site:threatfox.abuse.ch - For active malware IoCs and C2 servers
- site:urlscan.io - For recently scanned suspicious/malicious sites
- site:thedfirreport.com - For IoCs from recent ransomware and breach reports

For BENIGN IoCs (<is_malicious> = false), search for:
- Common cloud provider infrastructure that triggers false positives
- Major CDN networks and their IP ranges
- Public DNS resolvers and their addresses
- Legitimate enterprise services (email, collaboration tools)

Search strategy:
1. Identify what type of IoC you need based on the sample finding
2. Search the appropriate sites above for that IoC type
3. Select IoCs that match the finding's context
4. Ensure the IoC is currently active/valid
</tool_calling>

<tool_calling_success_criteria>
CRITICAL: Your sources array MUST include URLs that:
- Display the actual IoC you selected (not just general information)
- Come from your actual web search results
- Show the IoC in context (threat feed, IP range list, security report, etc.)

Each source must be a real URL from your search that contains the specific IoC used in your finding.
</tool_calling_success_criteria>

<real_world_iocs>
An IoC is considered a real-world IoC if it:
- Actually exists and is actively used on the internet
- Can be verified through public sources (DNS lookups, WHOIS, threat intel feeds)
- For benign IoCs: belongs to legitimate services like AWS, Microsoft, Google, CDNs, or other well-known providers
- For malicious IoCs: appears in current threat intelligence feeds or has been associated with actual attacks
</real_world_iocs>

<response_format>
Output a single, valid JSON object with exactly these two keys:
{
    "rationale": "<string>",
    "source_url": "<string>"
}

- `rationale`: A string explaining the reasoning or justification for the IoCs you chose. IoCs MUST be defanged in the rationale.
- `source_url`: A string containing the URL of the threat intel report or blog post that contains the IoCs.
</response_format>

<defanging_iocs>
- IP addresses: Replace dots with [.] (e.g., 192[.]168[.]1[.]1)
- Domains: Replace dots with [.] (e.g., malicious[.]domain[.]com)
- URLs: Replace dots and :// (e.g., hxxps://malicious[.]site[.]com)
- This applies to ALL IoCs in both the rationale and finding fields
</defanging_iocs>

<success_criteria>
- JSON fields in <sample_finding_file> are unchanged
- IoCs in in <sample_finding_file> are replaced with REAL VALUES with a match from the web search results
- <sample_finding_file> must remain a valid JSON object after `find_and_replace` is called
- `source_url` must be a real URL from your search that contains the specific IoC used in your finding
</success_criteria>

<example_rationale>
- "The EC2 instance made numerous metadata service requests to 169[.]254[.]169[.]254 which is normal behavior for AWS workloads retrieving IAM credentials. The high volume triggered the anomaly detection due to a newly deployed application polling for updated credentials."
- "Connections to outlook[.]office365[.]com from the EC2 instance were flagged as potential data exfiltration, but investigation revealed this was a legitimate email integration service syncing with Office 365."
- "DNS queries to 8[.]8[.]8[.]8 were flagged as potential DNS tunneling, but this is Google's public DNS resolver being used by the instance for normal domain resolution."
- "High volume requests to Akamai CDN IPs (104[.]74[.]58[.]4) triggered brute force detection, but these were legitimate API calls to a SaaS application using Akamai's infrastructure."
